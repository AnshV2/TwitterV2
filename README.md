This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkOSUVzOAA4&t=2334s but used appRouter instead of PageRouter in Next.JS and also implemented many other minor changes. 
Overall not a bad beginner full-stack project attempt, especially considering how short a time it took to make (gotta thank the t3 stack for that). 
Hope to use what I've learned this time to make something much bigger in the future.

The main Technologies I used for the project are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

It was deployed with Vercel and created using the Create_t3_app library. 
I personally found the developer experience pretty great although starting can be daunting. 
After a bit of work in the stack, it becomes quite intuitive and easy to use though :D. 
If you want to check out the code its all there!
